# CSE 168 Final Project
## What is the Assignment?
Our final project had the goal of creating a volumetric data visualizer in VR which allows for different viewing modes.
## How did we do it?
We accomplished this by using Meta's Quest tools for Unity. Specifically, the Scene SDK, which allows us to represent real world objects as game objects in Unity, was especially useful. You can read about it in more detail in our Writeup.
